This file was created to explain details about the Parser "basestrike.lua".


Parser details:

Name: basestriker.lua.
Language: lua, Version 5.1.4.
Metakeys generated: basehref.tag, basehref.value, basehref.full.
Status: Done. Maybe will need nome more testing.
Production: No.
Description: The "Basestrike.lua" parser was made to detect the "basestriker" attack. This attack uses the "base" tag on html fooling security solutions and successfully send malicious mail messages.
The parser was created based on the existance of the "<base" token, once the token is found the URL is parsed and joined with the content of the next "<a href" tag. Very helpfull as an alternative extract some intersting values from headers inside mail messages, and populate it inside a specific metakey. That info is very helpfull to detect possible phishing attempts( after a good WL is created )

Due to the fact that this parser was designed to parser Mail content, it is only on the MM Decoder, as it receives SMTP traffic to be parsed.
